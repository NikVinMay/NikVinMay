# Hey, I'm Nikhil 👋

I’m someone who grew up loving **football** and **Formula 1**, and somewhere along the line I realised that my engineering instinct to break systems apart fits perfectly with **machine learning** and the world of **raw data**.

My background began in **mechanical engineering** and evolved into **computer science**, but the common thread has always been the same:  
I like understanding *how* things work — whether it’s an F1 power unit, a high press, or a dataset with hidden patterns.

That curiosity naturally pulls me deeper into:
- machine learning  
- data analysis  
- model behaviour  

…and also into other parts of computer science like cloud, software infrastructure, and tooling — not because I set out to specialise in them, but because they help me **build, scale, and experiment better** with the things I care about.

## 🏎️⚽ Engineering + Sports + ML  
Mechanical engineering gave me the mindset of:
- optimisation  
- system behaviour  
- efficiency  
- modelling cause-and-effect  

Football taught me:
- unpredictability  
- human data  
- flow  
- context  

Machine learning lets me merge these worlds — using structure + intuition to turn observations into insight.

## 🔍 What I Like Working On
- Predictive modelling (football, medical data, behaviour)
- CNNs, DNNs, hybrid neural architectures  
- Understanding how models think  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Small, practical ML projects  
- Experimenting with cloud + software tools when they help the workflow

## 🧩 Projects That Show This Blend

### ⚽ **FPL Player Performance Predictor**
Using historical EPL data to forecast performance — mixing football intuition with regression modelling and feature engineering.

### 🫁 **Lung Cancer Classifier (HDCN)**
A hybrid CNN/DNN model that detects early-stage patterns the way an engineer reads system signatures.

### ❤️ **Heart Disease Predictor (Hybrid-CNN)**
A project exploring how structured tabular data and CNNs can be combined intelligently.

### 🔐 **ECC for IoV**
End-to-end elliptic curve cryptography pipeline for secure communication in Internet-of-Vehicles systems.

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech I Enjoy
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn**  
- **TensorFlow/Keras (CNNs, DNNs)**  
- **Jupyter Notebooks**  
- **MATLAB / Simulink (engineering side)**  
- **Azure / AWS (when projects need scaling or deployment)**  
- **General software tools** that help me experiment better  

---

## 🌱 What I’m Exploring
- More ML pipelines that connect engineering intuition + data  
- Deeper understanding of neural network behaviour  
- Cleaner project structure and reproducible experiments  
- Using cloud/services *only when they make the project stronger*
