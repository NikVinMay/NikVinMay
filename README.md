# Hey, I'm Nikhil 👋

I grew up loving **football** and **Formula 1**, and somewhere along the way I realised my engineering instinct to break systems apart fits perfectly with **machine learning** and the world of **raw data**.

I began in **mechanical engineering**, shifted into **computer science**, and eventually found a space where both meet:  
understanding how systems behave — whether it’s an F1 chassis, a football match, or a dataset full of hidden dynamics.

That curiosity naturally pulls me into:
- machine learning  
- data analysis  
- neural architectures  
- understanding model behaviour  
- cloud + software tools that help me experiment better

## 🏎️⚽ Engineering + Sports + ML  
Mechanical engineering taught me optimisation, system modelling, and cause–effect reasoning.  
Football taught me flow, unpredictability, and human data.  
Machine learning lets me blend these — intuition + structure → insight.

## 🔍 What I Like Working On
- Predictive modelling (football, medical, behavioural)
- CNNs, DNNs, hybrid neural networks  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- Lightweight, practical ML projects  
- Cloud and backend tools when they support the ML workflow
